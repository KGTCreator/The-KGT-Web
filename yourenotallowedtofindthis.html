    <h1>Secret?</h1>


    <p>Wait, how did you get here?</p>
    <p>You cliked on "more ways than one" didn't you? And I suppose that you expected a secret?</p>
    <p>Well, I ain't saying it! So you're out of luck!</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>You're not leaving?</p>
    <p>Alright, fine.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
      <h4 class="alert-heading">The Reasons I Like MLAATR:</h4>
      <p>1. I can relate to the premise, thus I can feel for the character a lot better.</p>
      <p>2.There are a whole lot of robots. As you could tell, that gets my attention really fast!</p>
      <p>3.There is an overarching storyline. Not only is it a fun little fact about the show, but it is also what
        inspired me with my hobby back home.</p>
      <p>4. Alright fine, I kinda had a crush on "XJ-9" at some point. DON'T YOU DARE JUDGE ME!</p>
