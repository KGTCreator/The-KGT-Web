    <h1>List of Stories:</h1>
      <a>My stories are all part of a giant universe, under the name "The KGT Non-Cinematic Universe!" It all started back in 2019, when I made a rewrite of a fanfiction that I had found a few months before. Overtime, it evolved into multiple stories. All with their own unique elements, and all encapsulated by a mysterious narrator that records it all.</a>

      <a>The KGT NCU consits of:</a>
      <ol> 
      <li>TLBT Finale Saga</li>
      <li>The MDS Adventures</li>
      <li>The Total Control Series</li>
      <li>E.X.T.R.A's</li>
      </ol>

      <a>Each one tells a certain part of a massive story. All from the perspectives of different characters across the Multiverse.</a>

      <ol>
        <li>TLBT Finale: This was the first of the bunch I made. This saga continues The Last Before Time, crossing over with Godzilla, The Daily Object Show, The MDS Adventures, and more. Telling a massive story about how this legendary children's movie series ends!</li>
        <li>MDS: For a while, this was the primary series. It follows the adventures of a pack of heros known as the Multiverse Defense Society, where they face off against a singular foe across different dimensions.</li>
        <li>TTCS: The most reccent of them all. This combines the stories of My Life As A Teenage Robot, Transformers, Murder Drones, and more Sci-Fi properties into a giant story packed with robots, death, justice, war, comody, redemption, and lots of recognizable faces!</li>
        <li>E.X.T.R.A.S: Basically where all the extra things I do go!</li>
